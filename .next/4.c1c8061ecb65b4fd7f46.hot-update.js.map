We were at the finest Indonesian restaurant that I could found in Berlin. You ate Sate for the first time and we discussed about the interior of the restaurant. It was very clear in my memory, how the way you stared me, smiled to me, and hold my hand has nothing changed until now…\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            Back then, we had been together only for 3 weeks, very excited, curious, and lovely. However, there was something I regret from that time, I was not able to live fully at the moment with you, uncertainty was always let me down sometimes. But it was you, your warm-hearted, that made me want to say to my young me “It is a life, there’re always ups and downs, and you are gonna work on it together with a man in front of you”. Gladly we have made this far :)\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            I really thanked for everything you did to me at that time, your lovely presents and the time together. It was the best birthday dinner I ever had. Followed by many birthday dinners together afterwards. I feel I am a luckiest girl in the world by having you.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            Berlin, 11th August 2043\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            Yours\n            \n</p>\n</div>\n    )\n}\n\n\nexport default Letter\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// components/letter.js"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAeA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AACA;AAEA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
